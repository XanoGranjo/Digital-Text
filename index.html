    explores precisely this issue. “I found an urgent need to start asking pointed questions,” Tejada writes. “To use my voice and begin to puncture through the sanitized veneer of 
    <span>D</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>i</span><span>g</span><span>n</span>
    , its Traditions and its preference for privilege, homogeneity, exclusivity, wealth, and elitism. From my current perspective, many of these Traditions uphold the status quo, and in essence harken back to the ‘good old days’.”

    Tejada’s use of the word puncture is apposite. The Providence-based

    <span>s</span><span>h</span><span>a</span><span>p</span><span>e</span>, or

    To get a better understanding of the current state of

    , I spoke to Felix Ofori Dartey, PADI’s Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The son of a Ghanaian 
    <span>d</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>i</span><span>g</span><span>n</span> 
    academic, Ofori Dartey studied in the UK where he completed his MA at the University of Leeds. While a student, and in an attempt to ensure that his own practice included a professional dimension, Ofori Dartey’s tutors encouraged him to take part in various 
    <span>g</span><span>r</span><span>a</span><span>p</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>c</span> 
    <span>d</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>i</span><span>g</span><span>n</span>
     awards schemes. This, in turn, inspired him to set up an awards scheme for Ghana. But when he showed the entries to his UK tutors they were puzzled. “Are you sure this work was made in Ghana? It’s too Eurocentric. Where’s the 
     <span>A</span><span>f</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>c</span><span>a</span><span>n</span>  
     <span>d</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>i</span><span>g</span><span>n</span> 
     identity?”

    This observation led him to consider what an

    <span>d</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>i</span><span>g</span><span>n</span> 
    identity might be: “Talking about it with friends,” he says, “we quickly realized that we can’t come up with just one identity. We can’t even say what a Ghanaian 
    <span>d</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>i</span><span>g</span><span>n</span> 
    identity is—there are so many different aspects—so how are we going to do it for fifty-four countries in 
    <span>A</span><span>f</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>c</span><span>a</span>  
    , all with different cultures?” 
    But can

    <span>d</span><span>e</span><span>s</span><span>i</span><span>g</span><span>n</span> 
    identities emerge at a time when global capitalism seeks the “homogeneity” and “sanitized veneer” that Ramon Tajada so rightly opposes?

        <p>Eu escolhi este texto, pois aborda questões críticas e oportunas sobre a diversidade no design gráfico, a preservação de identidades culturais e a resistencia contra a padronização global.
            A discussão sobre a necessidade de uma identidade de design africana destaca a importância de reconhecer e valorizar as diversas expressões culturais na prática do design.
